# Learning Words iOS App

This is the code for the current app project I am working on. The app is meant to be used by teachers/tutors that are working with children on learning words. 
The initial goal is to have an app that the user can create units of words, then take those words and use them within the flashcards tab to work with the student. 
They are swipe left for incorrect and right if the student answers correctly, then the app will keep count of the correct answers.

## Language and Tools

This was made within XCode with SwiftUI. I created the AppIcon with Adobe Express.

2. Modify the cards and units to allow for images and reveal options to expand the app use.
3. Categories to group Units based on needs
4. List or Grid options to show Units
5. And more as feedback is given
